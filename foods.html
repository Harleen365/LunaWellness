            <h1>Breathing Exercise</h1>
            <p>Box breathing, also known as four-square breathing, is a simple and effective technique to promote relaxation. To practice, sit comfortably and inhale slowly through your nose to a count of four, filling your lungs. Hold your breath for another count of four, then exhale slowly through your mouth to a count of four, and hold your breath again for a final count of four. Repeat this cycle for 5-10 minutes, focusing on maintaining a steady rhythm and relaxing your shoulders. This exercise helps reduce stress and improve focus.
