                <p><strong>Causes:</strong> Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is primarily caused by hormonal imbalances, insulin resistance, and genetic factors. These factors contribute to irregular menstrual cycles and excess androgen production.</p>
                <p><strong>Effects:</strong> Common symptoms of PCOS include irregular periods, excess facial and body hair (hirsutism), acne, and ovarian cysts. PCOS can also affect fertility and increase the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease.</p>
